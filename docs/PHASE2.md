# Phase 2 — Library depth

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md#phase-2--library-depth) for the whole phase and [USABILITY.md](USABILITY.md) for the decisions behind it.

## Part 1: Open folder

**What it does.** **Open folder…** (Ctrl+O) adds a folder to the library where it is: nothing is copied. The folder is selected straight away and its photos appear in the grid as they are read, so rating and flagging can start at once. There is one library model (owner's decision after the round-2 research): an opened folder is an ordinary library folder, and every library feature works on it. Removing photos from the library never deletes files.

| Behaviour | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Background indexing | Files are found first, then read in parallel (metadata + embedded preview) by the same worker pool as Import. Results are written to the catalog in batches of up to 48, or every 0.4 s, so the grid fills in steadily. A panel in the left column shows progress and a **Stop** button. | LightBench |
| Thumbnails | From the camera's embedded JPEG. The Loupe shows the full-size embedded preview with a **Camera preview** badge; the RAW itself is rendered in Develop. | darktable's default `plugins/lighttable/thumbnail_raw_min_level = never` ("for unaltered images, use raw file instead of embedded JPEG from size") |
| Subfolders | Included in the grid by default; a **Subfolders** toggle in the filter bar shows only the selected folder. The choice is remembered in this browser. | Owner's choice. darktable's own import default is non-recursive (`ui_last/import_recursive = false`). |
| RAW + JPEG pairs | A JPEG with the same name as a RAW in the same folder is left out, as Import does by default. The RAW owns the shared sidecar. | darktable groups such pairs with the RAW as group representative (`src/common/image.c`, `_image_import_internal`); LightBench has no stacks yet (Phase 2). |
| Sidecars | An existing `name.xmp` (Lightroom/LightBench) or `name.ext.xmp` (darktable) brings its rating, label, flag and LightBench edits. | As Import, Part 3 |
| Look for new photos | The **⟳** button on the selected folder adds files that appeared since. Opening the same folder again does the same. Files already in the library are skipped by path. | Lightroom's "Synchronize Folder"; darktable re-imports a film roll |
| Opening a parent folder | If the new folder contains folders already in the library, they become part of it (their photos, ratings and edits move with them), so no photo is listed twice. | LightBench |
| Permissions | Open folder asks only to read. Writing sidecars asks for write permission once per folder, through the existing banner. | Part 3 |

**Import** now only copies (from cards, with an optional backup). Its old "add in place" mode is replaced by Open folder.

**Not yet:**
- Photos deleted or moved outside LightBench stay in the library until removed (Lightroom marks them "missing"; planned).
- Reading only the embedded-preview bytes from each RAW, instead of the whole file, would make indexing faster on slow drives (also listed for Import).

**Verified** (headless Chromium, `e2e-open`):
- A folder with `day1/A.NEF`, `day2/B.NEF` + `B.JPG` and `day2/C.jpg` + `C.xmp` (3 stars, Blue) gives 3 photos, without the companion JPEG. C.jpg arrives with 3 stars and the Blue label.
- First thumbnail about 1.4 s after choosing the folder (D700 NEF, software GPU).
- Opening `day1` first and then its parent `Photos` leaves one library folder `Photos` with `day1` and `day2` and no duplicates.
- Subfolders off on `Photos` shows 0 photos (none directly in it); on shows 3.
- A file added to `day1` appears after **⟳**; a second **⟳** reports "No new photos".
- The Loupe on a RAW shows the **Camera preview** badge. The Import window has no "add" mode.

## Part 2: Full-screen culling

**What it does.** **F** (or the **Cull** button) opens the photos shown in the grid full-screen, starting at the focused one. Flags, stars and labels go to the photo on screen, never to an old selection or the photo under the mouse. darktable's default does the opposite (`plugins/lighttable/act_on`: "prioritize the hovered image over the selected images"), which the round-2 research found causing mistakes (darktable issue #6025).

| Behaviour | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Keys | P pick · X reject · U unflag · 0–5 stars · 6–9 labels · ←/→ (or Space) move · Home/End · Z or click: 100 % · C 1-up/2-up · Tab switch photo in 2-up · A auto-advance · I info · D develop · Esc/G/E/F close | Lightroom keys, as in the grid |
| Auto-advance | On by default (owner's choice), with an on-screen toggle that is remembered; Caps Lock also advances, as in Lightroom. | Lightroom's Caps Lock auto-advance |
| 2-up (C) | The photo and the next one side by side (owner's choice). The active one has a gold outline and receives the keys; Tab or a click switches. | darktable's culling layout shows 2 images by default (`plugins/lighttable/culling_num_images = 2`) |
| Previews | The camera's embedded JPEG (badge "Camera preview"), with the grid thumbnail shown until it loads. The next two photos and the previous one are loaded in advance. | darktable's default for unedited images |
| 100 % | Always the photo itself, rendered at full resolution with its Develop settings by the same path as Export (owner's choice), so focus is judged on real pixels. Badge "100 % · full rendering". Click to zoom on a point, drag to pan, click again to fit. In 2-up both photos zoom to the same spot. While the render runs (a few seconds) the fitted preview stays with a note. Renders for photos already passed are skipped. | darktable culling zoom-to-100 % (`src/dtgtk/culling.c`) |
| Filmstrip, info line, key hints | Bottom filmstrip (±20 photos) with flags, stars and labels; top line with file name, stars, flag, label, exposure, lens and capture time (I hides it); a key reminder line. | Owner's choice |
| Stable list | The photos are fixed when culling starts, so rejecting a photo while "Hide rejected" is on doesn't make it vanish mid-cull. | LightBench |

**Verified** (headless Chromium, `e2e-cull`, two NEFs and a JPEG):
- P on the first photo picked it and moved to the second; 3 rated the second and moved on; with auto-advance off, X rejected the third and stayed.
- In 2-up, Tab then 7 put the Yellow label on the right-hand photo only.
- Z rendered the D700 NEF at 100 % in 16–18 s on the software GPU used for testing; a hardware GPU is much faster (owner's GPU still to be measured). Panning works.
- After Esc the grid shows the same flags, stars and labels.

## Part 3: Keywords

**What it does.** Hierarchical keywords, stored and exchanged exactly as darktable and Lightroom do.

| Behaviour | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | Paths like `Places|Canada|Ottawa`, case-insensitive (the first spelling is kept). | darktable's tag names (`src/common/tags.c`) |
| Adding | Right panel **Keywords** box, **Ctrl+K** (Lightroom's shortcut). Commas separate keywords; “>” (or “|”) makes a hierarchy: `Places > Canada > Ottawa`. Suggestions match any level of existing keywords, most-used first; ↑/↓ and Enter pick. | Lightroom keywording |
| Several photos | Applies to the selection. Keywords on only some photos show as dashed chips with a count (“Glarus 1/2”); click to add to all. × removes from all selected. | Lightroom |
| Keyword list | Left panel, under Folders: a tree with photo counts. Click shows every photo with that keyword or one below it; the filter bar shows it with × to clear. Hover × deletes a keyword (and those below it) from the library and from the photos' sidecars, after a confirmation. | Lightroom keyword list; darktable tagging dictionary |
| Search | The search box also matches keywords. | LightBench |
| Sidecars | Written as `dc:subject` (every level, once each) and `lr:hierarchicalSubject` (full paths). Read from `lr:hierarchicalSubject`, else `dc:subject`; darktable's internal `darktable|…` tags are ignored. | darktable `src/common/exif.cc` (`_exif_xmp_read_data` writes, `_exif_import_tags` reads), `omit_tag_hierarchy` default off |
| JPEGs | Keywords (and ratings, labels) embedded in a JPEG's own XMP are read when there is no sidecar. | Lightroom/Bridge write XMP into JPEGs |
| Older libraries | Photos added before keywords existed keep their sidecar keywords: they are read in before LightBench first rewrites the sidecar, and **⟳** (Look for new photos) reads them for a whole folder. | LightBench (schema v5 `keywords_read`) |
| Export | Keywords included by default as a flat list; **Include the keyword hierarchy** adds `lr:hierarchicalSubject`. | darktable export defaults: `DT_META_TAG` on, `DT_META_HIERARCHICAL_TAG` off (`src/common/metadata_export.c`) |

**Not yet:** renaming or moving a keyword, synonyms, "don't export" (darktable's category/private flags), keyword sets, and IPTC-IIM keywords inside JPEGs.

**Verified** (headless Chromium, `e2e-keywords`): a Lightroom sidecar's `Places|USA|Philadelphia` and a JPEG's embedded “Embedded” keyword were read; `Places > Switzerland > Glarus, Lake` plus a suggestion picked from “phila” were added; the sidecar got `dc:subject` [Lake, Places, Switzerland, Glarus, USA, Philadelphia] and `lr:hierarchicalSubject` [Lake, Places|Switzerland|Glarus, Places|USA|Philadelphia]; multi-select showed “Glarus 1/2”; the “Places” filter showed 2 photos; search found the JPEG by keyword; deleting “Lake” removed it from the sidecar.
