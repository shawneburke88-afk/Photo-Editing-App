# Phase 2 — Library depth

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md#phase-2--library-depth) for the whole phase and [USABILITY.md](USABILITY.md) for the decisions behind it.

## Part 1: Open folder

**What it does.** **Open folder…** (Ctrl+O) adds a folder to the library where it is: nothing is copied. The folder is selected straight away and its photos appear in the grid as they are read, so rating and flagging can start at once. There is one library model (owner's decision after the round-2 research): an opened folder is an ordinary library folder, and every library feature works on it. Removing photos from the library never deletes files.

| Behaviour | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Background indexing | Files are found first, then read in parallel (metadata + embedded preview) by the same worker pool as Import. Results are written to the catalog in batches of up to 48, or every 0.4 s, so the grid fills in steadily. A panel in the left column shows progress and a **Stop** button. | LightBench |
| Thumbnails | From the camera's embedded JPEG. The Loupe shows the full-size embedded preview with a **Camera preview** badge; the RAW itself is rendered in Develop. | darktable's default `plugins/lighttable/thumbnail_raw_min_level = never` ("for unaltered images, use raw file instead of embedded JPEG from size") |
| Subfolders | Included in the grid by default; a **Subfolders** toggle in the filter bar shows only the selected folder. The choice is remembered in this browser. | Owner's choice. darktable's own import default is non-recursive (`ui_last/import_recursive = false`). |
| RAW + JPEG pairs | A JPEG with the same name as a RAW in the same folder is left out, as Import does by default. The RAW owns the shared sidecar. | darktable groups such pairs with the RAW as group representative (`src/common/image.c`, `_image_import_internal`); LightBench has no stacks yet (Phase 2). |
| Sidecars | An existing `name.xmp` (Lightroom/LightBench) or `name.ext.xmp` (darktable) brings its rating, label, flag and LightBench edits. | As Import, Part 3 |
| Look for new photos | The **⟳** button on the selected folder adds files that appeared since. Opening the same folder again does the same. Files already in the library are skipped by path. | Lightroom's "Synchronize Folder"; darktable re-imports a film roll |
| Opening a parent folder | If the new folder contains folders already in the library, they become part of it (their photos, ratings and edits move with them), so no photo is listed twice. | LightBench |
| Permissions | Open folder asks only to read. Writing sidecars asks for write permission once per folder, through the existing banner. | Part 3 |

**Import** now only copies (from cards, with an optional backup). Its old "add in place" mode is replaced by Open folder.

**Not yet:**
- Photos deleted or moved outside LightBench stay in the library until removed (Lightroom marks them "missing"; planned).
- Full-screen culling view: next PR.
- Reading only the embedded-preview bytes from each RAW, instead of the whole file, would make indexing faster on slow drives (also listed for Import).

**Verified** (headless Chromium, `e2e-open`):
- A folder with `day1/A.NEF`, `day2/B.NEF` + `B.JPG` and `day2/C.jpg` + `C.xmp` (3 stars, Blue) gives 3 photos, without the companion JPEG. C.jpg arrives with 3 stars and the Blue label.
- First thumbnail about 1.4 s after choosing the folder (D700 NEF, software GPU).
- Opening `day1` first and then its parent `Photos` leaves one library folder `Photos` with `day1` and `day2` and no duplicates.
- Subfolders off on `Photos` shows 0 photos (none directly in it); on shows 3.
- A file added to `day1` appears after **⟳**; a second **⟳** reports "No new photos".
- The Loupe on a RAW shows the **Camera preview** badge. The Import window has no "add" mode.
